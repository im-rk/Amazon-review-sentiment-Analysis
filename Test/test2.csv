"The sound quality was fine, but there is serious lack of durability, stopped fully working within a month of daily use."
"Though this is the cheapest earphones it does not have a good mic. It is best used only for listening music or movies. Doesn't have a great bass, or mids. It is not worth the ₹549. It is also fragile. Not recommended to buy."
I chose only with the confidence I had on brand name. Totally disappointed. Got seviere ear pain after using this.
"Ear phone stopped working within 1 month time without any physical damage, customer service not working only I will work till IVT, line will disconnect while connecting to customer care executive.Requested for replacement thru email, have to see response. Will update once I get update.Update :Replacement request is honoured, I got full refund within few days of sending mail. Thanks for quick response."
It's an average product and slightly over priced compared to similar products available in the market.
"These are okay. Bought 2 pairs at Christmas (it’s February when I’m writing this review) and one is already broken. Just basic daily usage.I don’t love talking on these kind of headphones because they plug my ears so well making it that I can hear myself talk, if that makes sense.The other pair is all good for now. The price is right on these but don’t expect them to work forever."
"I got these for remote work since I'm on the go and do Hangouts, Skype calls, etc and needed the built-in microphone. They were decent while they worked, but now after 5 months, the left earbud has significantly dropped in volume. I guess I get what I paid for. I'll be getting something better instead (I'm very happy with my Klipsch, I'll probably get one of theirs with a mic)."
"They worked great after a while, but within a few weeks, they started SHOCKING my ears, and it was so painful that I had to pull them out. They kept electrocuting me on and off for no reason (maybe the static based off of previous reviews) and it was painful. Save yourself the shock and buy a different pair."
"I want to love these more, but I cannot find the combination that will keep them in my ears. I have had no problems with other headphones. I think it is the weight of the metal studs that cause them to pull out. I love the flat wire. never gets tangles"
"These earbuds work well enough for the price. The jack is a little off, a little hard to push into a device, and the buds themselves don't stay in my ears very easily, but the sound is very good, and the microphone works. I only paid @ $3 for them, so no complaints."
Not much bass and OK audio quality. I actually gave them to someone because they had no headphones. I mean you get what you pay for here. A good knock around pair of earbuds. You won't be upset if you lose them or whatever.
"I usually have great luck with amazon basics products, but these only lasted a week and already fell apart:("
"Sound is good, but don't stay put in ears as good as others I have used."
"The sound quality is good, but they are dreadfully uncomfortable."
Fell out of my ears constantly
They are okay
Odd shaped.  They are alright.
Not impervious to damage by normal ware and tare use. Mic failed.
I chose only with the confidence I had on brand name. Totally disappointed. Got seviere ear pain after using this.
Oridary. Costly. Quality is not good. Not worth more than  200-250. If you want to buy online then select the one with lower price as performance is same. And wort of all that there is no return policy perhaps because the dealer knows that every one would want to return. Surpringly Amazon has given its name to it.
Design is good.  Sound quality is not so good.  Noise reduction poor.  The 3.5 mm jack is very tight.  The in-ear stuff is not soft and not holding into the ear.
Did not receive extra earbuds
"I'm sure these work great, if I could keep them in my ears that is. Although the appearance of the earbuds have nice chrome look and are practically designed with a mic and a clip to keep them close to the body, the ear part itself, is poorly fitted to actual use and I cannot get them to stay in (even when switching out the squishy in-ear part)."
after a few minutes to an hour or so one side or the other begins to barely make any sound. over the course of a few days usage it was very frustrating for first one side then the other stopped working properly time after time.
Bought these when they were a little cheaper and they sound good. After 2 months the left ear stopped working as well as the play/pause/siri button. If the price falls below $5 I will buy again
The sound quality was good but the earbuds are heavy on the outside and kept falling out of my ears.  It didn't matter what size earbuds I put on.  Overall good sound really uncomfortable
This headphones are not good enough to handle when traveling or sitting due to weight of ear plugs. They slipped out of ear and hard to handle. Sound quality is good.
"Decent sound. Mic is terrible though. Also, this pair has fallen apart after only a handful of months.Will be investing in a higher quality product."
"Sound is OK but the annoying part is that it keeps falling off the ear, doesn't stay in."
Sound comes out of the headphones uneven after while. You get what you pay for I suppose.
Worked great for a few months but then 1 side quit working
"Good sound, but ended up breaking relatively soon after purchase, just over a month."
"Tried all 3 cushions, doesn't fit ear well."
Knurled aluminum ends are not comfortable.

"The trend of removing the headphone port has been a pain in the you_know_where for the last ~5 years. They force us to buy bluetooth earphones which are good in certain ways, but are inconvenient in many ways.1. Everlasting need for the battery and charging.2. Always worried for loosing a piece.3. Connection is not instant, further changing the device wastes time.4. And there are connection and pairing issues.5. More expensive and inferior quality of sound compared to similarly priced wired earphones.6. Call quality is pathetic unless one buys a flagship one.7. Active noise cancellation with transparency mode is again flagship feature (ie comes with a high price).8. After the use is over, there is an added task to put the earphone back to the case (to ensure that they are not lost, and charge them for the next use).This type c earphone solved all those issues, like good old days, when listening to music or attending a call was as simple as just a plug and play.Currently I use two mobile phones, a Samsung Galaxy A52s (I purchased it only for it had a headphone jack), a Google Pixel 6a, and an iPad Air 4. The later two lack a headphone jack and I always have to pair to a bluetooth earphone to watch videos, listening to music or attending calls. Changing connection between an Android and iOS is always a pain with poor compatibility.For this earphone specifically;a. Sound quality: Descent for the price. I am a musician, and always look for the perfect blend (I use Sennheiser and AudioTechnica for that purpose). Having said that, I can safely comment that you'll not regret the quality.b. Ergonomics: Earpieces are little bulky than I prefer. But I go to sleep with these earphones and it didn't give me a pain.c. Component quality: The earpieces are sturdy. The stock earplug fits perfectly to my ear (there are other sizes provided in the box). The cord is matt soft touch rubber which I am not very confident about how long they are going to last. Similar material was also on the more expensive Sennheiser ones that I used earlier and those broke exposing the metal wire inside after 1.5-2 years.d. Functions: I was blown that apart from the call receive/decline button, there are also volume up-down buttons (unusual for the price).e. Compatibility: Surprising further, all those buttons work perfectly in all those devices (A52s, Pixel 6a and iPad). Tell you what, although there is no sound, the buttons work as intended for the Mac also.Problems are minor;1. With Pixel, sometimes it will get disconnected within minutes, and reattaching resolves the problem. It may occur repeatedly 2-3 times in a row, or it may not occur at all. I don't get the reason, but the way it gets disconnected, it appears that might the some kind of software restriction from the Pixel. It happened with no other device.Verdict: Over last few years, it is one of the best electronic device I have purchased. It genuinely has a potential to ruin the malpractice of removing the headphone port. This is I firmly believe the reason for not having too many options for a USB type C earphone, as they force us to buy more expensive but poor value bluetooth earphones. I got it for roughly Rs 600/- in the Great Indian Festival. Even if it was 800-1k (which is the usual price), it will be value for money."
This product purchase on 31st May 2024. I didn't check properly warranty period its my fault. Any product related to headphones category have minimum 6 month to 1 year warranty.  But here only 90 days warranty. After purchasing first 30 days Headphones C part cover open..I think headphones is working so use it...but from 1 month product not connected and error show USB connect to unauthorized device.I think Amazon basis product was Good but here product quality was poor. Don't purchase this device not up to the mark and not recommend value for money.
"The sound quality was fine, but there is serious lack of durability, stopped fully working within a month of daily use."
Tear the cable in two weeks..... Normal quality weast of money
The sound quality and fit of this type c earphone is good according to its price. It works seamlessly in my smartphone and laptop by plugging it in the type C port. Recommended to those looking for an affordable type C earphone.
It's definitely a value for money product. Performance is good enough. I have been using it for my teams calls and it's been pretty good experience. Earphones looks durable and it's length is long enough for calls. Overall a nice and budget friendly product for my work management.

Good for music lovers who love deep bass.The cable is good.
"The best C type wired earphone with great sound quality and at an affordable price too, the product is really worth buying no doubt. I will give it 5/5"
as compare to other brands in market it is far better than else awesome sound quality very comfortable to use for hours much recommended best earphone in this price
Headset right side ear bud missing in the box.Quality of the product is not good.Sound quality is average.Not compatible with phones.Below average appearance.Not worth for value of money.
I have purchased this earphone in Sep2023 and it stopped working after only 3.5 months of use. It is not working since mid January. I would suggest not to buy this product. Instead buy other products with little higher prices.
Price worthy. Good quality sound
Only 1 day it worked fine. But the very next day headphones are getting connected to my mobile and connected symbol is showing on the top but still volume is coming from my mobile instead of headphones. I want to return this item.
Sound quality was good type c connector is good
"Using it for my online calls, the mic and headphone are working as expected. Build is also sturdy."
Its quite comfortable for me I like the quality of it and the sound quality is also good. It meet my expectation.
"Best earphone under this range, quality is awesome, tanglefree earphone, light weight, with great features and look awesome in black."
"The sound quality of earphones is just awesome, best type c earphones in this price segment, go for it blindly."
Good quality product sound is smooth and mic works perfectly and good material used worth the money
