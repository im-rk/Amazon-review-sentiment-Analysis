Waste of money.  It doesn't keep the brevarage hot. After 1 to 2hrs everything is back to normal.  Just like we keep tea or coffee in normal mug. It even doesn't keep thing hot for 30 min also. How ever look wise it is very nice and stylish.  But functional side is very poor. Don't buy it . Waste of money.
"The flask looks good with glossy finish and i bought it looking at Borosil brand, however it failed the leak test.The mechanism to open the lid has too many joins which causes the leakage.Giving 3 stars for aesthetics, functioning needs improvement."
"It works as described. keeps stuff hot/ cold for a long time, especially if you don't open the lid. If you sip it, of course, it loses heat/cold.However, the small silicone nipple that seals the opening is placed in such a way that it touches your forehead when you drink. and the internal moulding is such that you can only drink it from the front, not the side"
Don’t know why this has much hype . Have to rerun since liquid leaking from cap
Bought in July 2023…not regularly used… the lock button they have provided is not working now properly ..so think before buying it
Good but bahut jaldi paint utar raha hei.
Good... But not air tight... Leaking when kept in bag
Keeps drink warm but nit more than 3 hours
"Didn't like China as the country of origin. Have reservation about the purity & quality of materials used in manufacturing. No where in the product description on Amazon India, China figures as the country of origin. It should be made visible. A unit manufactured in October 2023 sold in January 2025. Should have been of recent origin."
Keeps decently hot for 1 to 2hrs. Leak proof so far ! It's very inconvenient to drink directly from it. Have to use another cup to pour into. Have to see how long it lasts.
It doesn't keep warm more than a hour
It's only keep my coffee 3/4hr warmAfter that it's cold
"Retains good heat for 4 hours, afterwards heat reduced considerably. easy to use. Good looking"
"The quality of the Borosil hot water mug is excellent – it feels durable, well-made, and keeps beverages hot for a good amount of time. The design is sleek and comfortable to hold, adding a premium feel to the experience. However, the price is on the higher side, especially considering similar options available in the market. If you’re looking for long-lasting quality and don’t mind spending a bit extra, this mug is a great choice."
I ordered 380 ml in black colour while it ws on discount but i received 300ml in white with no discount when it is very clear from the site given i can get in less amount..quite dissapointed with this changes from amazon..overall the quality of the product is not bad.
This mug only looks cute. Tea's taste got changed after 2 hours. It's not drinkable. It's good for cold items like cold coffee.
"Its hot for 2 hrs and drinkable till 3 hrs after that its very luke warm and pathetic and you need to warm the coffee again to enjoy it. So it miserably falls as an Travel Mug, I purchased it after reading excellent reviews  and highest ratings.Another issue is If you drink directly from the mug your nose will hit the pointed plastic thing, what a lousy design just spoils your drinking.So find it just a waste of money and old thermos is the best."
Everything about this product is good except one thing that is boiling coffee/ tea get cold within 2 hrs in it
It looks good but the water retention is not that great like other Milton silver flask.
Good quality but price to value ratio is bit on higher side given it’s 300ml only… should be under 500Has a lock option in flip mechanism for secure travelling and to avoid accidental opening of lid which is good…Actually on price thing.. If big brands increase prices because of quality and R&D that is understandable but this gives chances to local Indian brands to raise prices without much change in their quality improvement
Started leaking in 1st month. Dont know why but coffee smells hell in this container
"Gets the job done for 4 - 5 hours, ideal for office not for travel."
Before it’s even one year it stopped maintaining the liquid hot for less than 1/2 an hour
Overall the product is good. Does the job of keeping the beverage hot and cold for logn duration.The only problem i faced was the sipping part where when i try to sip the the uppr part of the cap touchs my nose and its very irritating and frustrating because there is no other angle to drink from this and the upper part constantly nudges the nose.
I have provided a used mug. I can smell Tea in the product. I have ordered a replacement.
"Does what's it's supposed to, keeping things hot etc. but how come within 2 months it's paint is starting to come off, wouldn't mind it looking old after it gets old not when it's brand new."
"I use this to carry hot coffee from home to work. It is leak proof which makes it easy to carry. However it does not keep my coffee hot for more than 1 hr. By the time I reach office, my hot coffee is lukewarm."
"It's color started coming out after 8-9 months. and that too only of top layer, and we can feel stickiness when we hold on top portion. I feel they should give a good quality paint. And d heat stays for about 4hrs approximately"
Good:Slim designAnti-Slip bottomFlip Cap can be open with one handSpill proofComplains:Rubber on the cap touches the nose everytime you take a sipMouth is narrow so not that easy to cleanCap flip mechanism is little complicated. Already stuck the lock once.Plastic quality on the cap looks cheapDesign is slippery
there was a drop in temp of the coffee after 3 hours of storeage
"The travel mug is decent, but it could be better. The capacity is a bit small for longer trips, and the price seems a tad high for what you get. The use of plastic and rubber components raises concerns about long-term durability and safety. If you're looking for a larger, more sustainable travel mug, you might want to explore other options."
Good
Easy to drink but item isnot more strong
"I've been using it on a regular basis for almost one year. I carry hot coffee in it. It stays warm for almost 4-5 hrs which is fine by me. But recently all of a sudden it started leaking. It hasn't been dropped or anything. So don't know what went wrong. Can't say it hasn't given me good service. But being from the brand Borosil, i expected it to work smoothly for atleast 2 yrs.Note: Initially, I have noticed that it used to leak at times. I figured that was due to air pressure. For example, if I put boiling hot coffee and close it instantly n lock it, it would leak. But then I used to open it, let it be open for few seconds n then close it, n then no more leaking. Now even that is not working."
After 4 to 5 hours the hotness will be reduced…
Won’t keep the tea/coffee hot for more than 2 or 3 hours. After that it becomes like warm.
The insulated flask is shown as matte finish where as it’s not.I am satisfied by the performance and ease of use but the advert is dubious.
I can advise Borosil to just leave it as plain stainless steel because the color start coming off after few days. So we have to finish it off because it starts looking ugly. Why not cut costs by not putting on the paint that customers will remove eventually? Or make last and let us pay for it.
Does the job but not for long time. Size and material wise okay.
"It's a sturdy product. No doubt about that.Now is it a useful / functional product?Here are my thoughts. It's not very efficient at holding heat. Expect your tea/coffee to go cold after 30-45 minutes, even when unopened.In the initial period, item looked beautiful, but after two months it started loosing paint around the neck and I don't use any abrasive scrub for washing it. So the paint quality is questionable.Oh it's made in China by the way.Considering the above experience, I would say it's an overpriced mediocre quality product sold by a reputed brand."
It's not easy to drink the coffee.  You have to tilt the cup fully to drink otherwise the cup edge will hit your nose.  Look out for other product.
Not easy to drink
"Projected as leak proof...but huge disappointment, to see it leaking from press lock button. Unfortunately noticed after return window closed.Rest, the product is great."
"It is handy, easy to carry, stays hot for max 2 hours.But the lid design cud have been better. You cannot sip directly from this, the lid is right on ur nose while you sip.Can drink with ease if it is full. Once the drink is reduce to half the mug lid is an hindrance.Especially not usable while on drive, lid is right on the nose and it covers  & completely obstructs the vision/road ahead of you while driving(bought this particularly to sip coffee daily morning while on my way to office.....1.5 hour drive ! Dint serve much of the purpose)."
Issue in insulation quality: This insulated coffee mug is not able to keep the temperature maintained of containing liquid for more than 2 hours.Not worth for the price paid.
It maintains the temperature for max 2 hours after which the drink starts to turn to room temp. I expected it to be better in terms of quality but it’s okay.
Its not copper coated but OK
"not leak proof, has been leaking after few months of daily use"
The shape of mouth of the cup is very weird. Unless you tilt it completely the coffee won’t come out. The top of cup will hit your nose.
Overall the mug design is good but issue is that hot beverages doesn't remain hot more than 2 hours.So think before you buy.
It doesn’t keep anything hot fr more than 1 hr. Not worthy!!! Despite it not serving the purpose yet I see ppl are giving it 4star. And then we are only duped so pls rate accordingly
looks and build quality is good. bt it cant hold hot tea for longer. company claim 8 hours. bt it hold hot tea only for 2-3 hours. then after it just keep normal hot.
"It's like generic Chinese made with borosil branding, keep liquid hot for 2 to 3 hours after that it fails to deliver."
It doesn't even keep the liquid hot for 2 hours.It is not 100% spill proof.
"Brand and design is good, but heat not remains till 8 hrs. Remains only 3-4 hrs of time."
It keeps the tea warm ( not hot) for about 3 hours.  The cup from outside gets heated mildly  meaning the heat escapes slowly.
As it said the liquid hot time is only 2 hours..waste of money not recommended
It difficult to drink from it. The design is bad.Retains temperature we'll.
The product is not as good as was expected of it
