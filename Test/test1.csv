"The overall experience was awesome,I would rate 8.7 on a scale of 10.The best parts of this laptop:1. Display: 144hz smooth display2. Keyboard: Backlit and best designed keyboard3. Gaming experience: No lag as it comes with 16gb Ram and 4gb RTX Graphic card.4. Transfer speed: The file transferred can be seen in an Image I've shared (C to C SSD).5. Ports: All the needful ports are provided, RJ45 port is eisely fitted in!6. Design: the laptop is designed so well, nice & attractive7. Overall experience: Best piece available on this price range...Some of things I didn't liked:1. Screen Wobble.2. Blue color is bit not good, black is preferable.3. Battery life is max to max 3 hrs. of light-mid performance tasks.4. The adapter is good and super fast charging speed type (200W) but its too heavy to carry. (Laptop weight is acceptable around 2.3kg).I would heavily recommend:Keep a cotton or thin cloth in between of screen and keyboard when you close your laptop, otherwise it will leave keyboard's dust spots on your screen which is not cleanable easily.Thanks!",,,,,,,,,
Really good for around 50k! Good battery life. Good performance. But the hinge quality was upsetting. Rattles even for fan blowing. You can even rattle it if you blow air yourself.,,,,,,,,,
"I’ve been using the HP Victus for a variety of tasks, including gaming, video editing, and basic office work, and overall, I’m impressed. Its gaming capability is excellent, handling demanding games like Red Dead Redemption 2 smoothly without any issues.For a gaming laptop, the battery life is surprisingly good. The 70Wh battery lasts up to 4 hours when performing lighter tasks, which is more than I expected. The only downside is the sound quality, which is quite average, but that’s manageable if you’re using headphones or external speakers.Overall, a solid choice for gamers and power users alike.",,,,,,,,,
It has a strong built and quality. The AMD Ryzen 5 processor is really fast. The sound quality is awesome. The screen quality and graphics card are the best in this range of laptops. The heating and battery life are as expected for the gaming laptops.,,,,,,,,,

"Laptop is worth the money and is upgradable. Fast processing and ease for creators. Make sure purchase with extended warranty for long usage. Sometimes the screen goes black, other than that everything is as mentioned. Only two USB ports available, one SSD card reader , One C type port, LAN port etc. It is worth the money. Buy it instead of a desktop because it is heavy to carry around. Desktop with similar configuration can be slightly expensive.",,,,,,,,,

"I had bought HP Victus Ryzen 5 series RTX3050 GPU laptop simply for my routine usage for office and other works, but this laptop is beast, doing best in gaming and other heavy task related works.Pros :1.) Price.2.) Premiumness.3.) Performance.4.) Top notch and lag free operation.5.) Gaming in budget.Cons.1.) No cons, except the Heat issues while gaming literally I got my lap baked 😂lol. Use laptop cooler. avoid using the laptop by keeping on bed or mattress it will block the air intake makes the laptop to heat.",,,,,,,,,
Really good for around 50k! Good battery life. Good performance. But the hinge quality was upsetting. Rattles even for fan blowing. You can even rattle it if you blow air yourself.,,,,,,,,,

"After using this laptop for more than a year, here's my review:Good laptop if you mostly want to play games, doing some heavy workload and/or occasionally some MS Office related stuff. But for me personally, it has got some issues.The touchpad works fine for some time and then it's starts having input lag. Like, there's a noticeable delay between swiping the finger and mouse pointer moving on the screen. It's really annoying when I have to precisely click on small things.The temporary soluton I got is, I disable and re-enable the touchpad using the hotkey on the keyboard. But it doesn't work forever, sometimes I have to do it again after a few seconds.The build quality isn't that great either, especially the hinge.If you live in a hot climate and have a fan blowing air from the side. The screen is going to wobble and steal your attention from whatever important stuff you might be doing.And if the wobbling thing can't steal your precious attention, then probably the sparkly backlit keyboard would. Especially, if you place the laptop on table a little bit far away with lights off at night. It's bright and there's no option to dim it.Also, If you're going to daily drive it to take it on work through public transport with the bag hanging on your shoulders for half an hour, then you're probably going to regret getting this 2.5 KG laptop.Otherwise, the performance is great for a laptop for this price range.TL;DRThis laptop is good as a tabletop with an external mouse. Otherwise buy a desktop.",,,,,,,,,
